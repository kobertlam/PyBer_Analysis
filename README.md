# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
As a Data Analyst at PyBer, you've been assigned to a new project to analyse all the ridershare data from January to early May of 2019 ([city_data.csv](Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv](Resources/ride_data.csv)), and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Based on the PyBer Summary DataFrame from Deliverable 1:
![PyBer Summary DataFrame](analysis/PyBer_Summary_DataFrame.png)
1. **Urban** has the highest values in **Total Rides**, **Total Drivers**, and **Total Fares**
2. **Rural** has the least values in terms of the **Total Rides**, **Total Drivers**, and **Total Fares**
3. When comparing with **Suburban** and **Rural**, **Urban** has 2.6 and 13 times more riders in **Total Rides**, and has about 5 and 31 times more drivers in **Total Drivers**
4. However, **Rural** has the highest values in **Average Fare per Ride** and **Average Fare per Driver**
5. **Urban** has the least values in **Average Fare per Ride** and **Average Fare per Driver**
6. When comparing the **Average Fare per Ride** among the city type, **Rural** has 1.1 and 1.4 times more than **Suburban** and **Urban**
7. When comparing the **Average Fare per Driver**, **Rural** has 1.4 and 3.3 times more than **Suburban** and **Urban**


Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary
 Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
