# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
As a Data Analyst at PyBer, you've been assigned to a new project to analyse all the ridershare data from January to end Apr of 2019 ([city_data.csv](Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv](Resources/ride_data.csv)), and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
